The day before the start of my internship at max ( automate ). 
Slightly nervous, anxious, excited for what this position will provide for me as well as what I have to provide for this posiiton.
Working hard to get to this spot by applying to over 220 internships and countless perfect online assessment scores.
This opportunity in particular is interesting because it came out of nowhere, almost bailing on the in person interview.
Personal skepticism was placed on this company because of the size, age, and area of business.
Prior to actually starting I have already learned Python, PANDAS, and some tableau.

Some goals that I would like to set before starting
    *   Build upon my current programming skills
    *   Learn how to build software that scales
    *   Gain knowledge of how technology consulting companies work 
    *   Discipline to be consistent coding every day
    *   Become the prize and be a valuable asset to the company
    *   Receive a return offer
