Slowly understanding how data is prepped and cleaned for easy processesing and dashboards.
Need to spend more time talking to people that are in my office and consume, consume, consume.
Must eat, digest, and write notes on information that I am learning.
No end in sight, but my chemistry is being changed slowly understanding the bigger picture.
