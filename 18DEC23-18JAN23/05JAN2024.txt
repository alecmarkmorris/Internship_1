Had my weekly review. Things are looking good, Definitely my boss's first pick.
Went over some other payment options such as:
    As it is currently
    "Salary" @ 19/hr approx. 3200 a month
    A School stipend to cover half of my education a month
Still going to go over and review this over the weekend in order to dicuss this weekend.
Have a 1 on 1 with Jose this monday and should write some notes.
Starting to take more tickets. Not the most efficient.
