Today is a new day.
Decided to take New Years Eve Eve Eve off to get some more sleep and rest.
Had a weekly review from my boss.
Lots of nerve leading up to this meeting.
Went a lot better than expected.
Both of us were on the exact same page. Have a lot of things to work on.
Agreed that this week was a step backwards. 
Some things that I should work on is:
    - Taking notes
    - Asking questions
    - Breaking down problems
        - Get in habit and breaking it down
            - and breaking it down even further
                - and even more to a binary yes or no, 1 or 0
Very positive, feel confince in me and realizes that I can do these tasks
must just get into habit of learning/ problem solving.
