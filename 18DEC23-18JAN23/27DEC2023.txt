---------
Learned a lot of excel and how it can be used for various purposes.
Definitely still want to learn more of the shortcuts within Excel.
Took some time to learn tableau prep and how to clean data and combine.
Had an exam that tested my abilities to use both products.
Failed miserably, did not ask questions, did not think through problems.
MUST improve, lacking in that area significantly.
Do not be afraid to ask questions:)
