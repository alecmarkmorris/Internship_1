Had a formal 1-on-1 with el jefe today.
First week went really well and have some positive things to look back on.
Also have some areas and technologies to work upon.
Seeing the bigger of this internship is refreshing to see how building upon knowledge is crucial.
Some areas I must work on are:
    * Taking more notes
    * Thinking through problem on paper first
        - Then working through in the applications
    * Crash course of excel
    * REQUEST lib in python
